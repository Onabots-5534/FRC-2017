NOTES
=====

* Make level robot. A front-to-back rock in the robot will be amplified at a height
  of six feet. How much? No signs on rocking robot. Consider hard wheels and omni.

* Lift mechanism. A couple of arms  with a single pivot point. Mostly vertical lift.
  Hard to tell if cascading or continuous lifts.

  Other research indicates a slight preference for cascade for stability - no one
  segment is at full extension.

  Include a take-up reel for downward motion instead of gravity.

  Chain, steel cable, line?

* Drivetrain. No mecanum yet. More 4 wheel than six. No mention of 3/4" bump in plans.

* Intake. So far no claws, only rollers.

  One ri3d discussed tipped cube issue and ripping fabric.

* Exhaust: one team using pneumatic kicker, others using rollers.

* Various Ri3D seem to be downplaying climbing. Have mentioned possibility of other
  teams hanings.
 
* Apparent consensus on defined roles. Climb/hang/scale vs switch/exchange.

* Locate battery (and gear boxes?) toward the back for counter weight to lift in front.

* Ensure Auto-Quest completion: 3 robots crossing line and ownership of switch



There are a large number of autonomous routines that can be used depending
upon the starting location and field configuration. 

Starting Location:
- Left
- Center
- Right

Each of these can have have one of the following maps.
- Cross baseline
- Do nothing

Preference is selected between switch and scale. Each of the these can be
in one of two configurations.


Sonic ranger placed at bottom of robot to detect switch and base of scale

Sonci ranger placed at back of robot to determine distance from field edge





SENSORS
=======

Drivetrain
- 4 spark

Navigation
- 2 encoders (maybe 1)
- 1 gyroscope
- 2 sonic ranger

BumpDetector
- 1 limit switch (maybe 0)

Climber
- 1 spark
- 1 limit switch (maybe 0)
- 1 encoder (maybe 0)

Lift
- 1 spark (maybe 2)
- 1 double solenoid
- 2 limit switch (maybe 0)
- 1 encoder
- 1 sonic ranger (maybe 0)

Kicker
- 1 double solenoid

	the bump detector would function as a limit switch that sets a varible when
	contacted. even better, it remains set so as to not miss the bump. Combined with a
	sonic ranger on the back, we should be able to position on the scale. Hopefully no
	bumping into an opponent robot doing the same thing.
	
	Consider making a vision system that looks for the color of the blocks on the bottom
	of the scale. not sure if this would be remotely useful since the base is parallel
	to the scale
	
	in fact, not sure if vision will be of any use at all

	

QUESTIONS
=========

Can we move into the null zone during autonomous?
